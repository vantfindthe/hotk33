"""Device LED layouts.

A Layout describes one device's LEDs, in the order the device expects them:
  rects   (x, y, w, h) per LED in key units, used to draw the preview
  xs, ys  normalized positions 0..1 used by effects (x: left->right, y: top->bottom)
  height  0 at the bottom row .. 1 at the top row
  linear  per-LED flag: LED is part of a strip (fan ring, ARGB strip, zone)
          rather than a 2-D key grid; effects use 1-D variants for these
  round   draw LEDs as dots instead of keycaps
